## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Lukas Macha

I am a DIYer, tinkerer, self-taught roboticist, dad, avid reader and a PhD student. Currently, I spend most of my time revolutionizing validation of complex, software-intensive systems as part of my PhD research at the University of Bath, UK.

Through leveraging Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and the Systems Modelling Language (SysML), my research tackles key challenges in the field:

1) Bridging the gap between system-level modelling and system science, creating a more holistic and integrated approach.
2) Advocating for purpose-driven system modelling and design, ensuring each element serves a clear, valuable function.
3) Establishing a continuous verification tool-chain for cyber-physical systems, enhancing the reliability and security of these complex systems.
4) Encouraging agile enrichment of traditional development processes, promoting flexibility and responsiveness in the face of change.
5) Developing processes, methods, and tools for truly consistent system development approaches, ensuring uniformity and coherence across projects.

I strive to blend academic theory with practical applications, emphasizing the convergence of digital and real-world testing methodologies. My research promises to redefine conventional vehicle development, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and accelerating delivery timelines through frontloading - minimal need for physical prototypes. 

With my unique blend of skills and experience, I am ready to contribute meaningfully to a progressive technology, driving innovation and elevating product development standards.
